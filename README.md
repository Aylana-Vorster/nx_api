NX VMS API Implementations

An NX class to create and get information from a pre-existing NX VMS with pre-existing cameras on the VMS. You would need a username and password allowed to use the API to authenticate to get a token for each transaction.

The API version used is v1 as not all VMS has been updated to v2 universally yet.
